# How to get more control over peace conferences in Hearts of Iron IV
 
Hearts of Iron IV is a grand strategy game that simulates World War II from 1936 to 1948. One of the most important aspects of the game is the peace conference, where the victorious countries decide how to divide the defeated countries among themselves. However, many players find the peace conference system frustrating and unrealistic, as the AI often makes illogical and ahistorical decisions that ruin the immersion and balance of the game.

Fortunately, there are some mods that can improve the peace conference experience and give players more control over the outcome. In this article, we will introduce two popular mods that address different aspects of the peace conference system: Player-Led Peace Conferences and Enhanced Peace Conference AI.
 
## Player-Led Peace Conferences
 
This mod gives players full and direct control of peace conference proceedings in wars they are involved in. Wars without player involvement conclude as normal. Currently supports patch 1.12 and above. If you're playing on version 1.10 or 1.11, please use the legacy version of this mod instead[^1^].
 
This mod makes no changes to anything else other than peace conference AI and is compatible with any and all other mods and will work in multiplayer games. There are a few limitations to this mod that can't (yet) be fixed due to being hardcoded: It's currently only possible to grant land to allies, so you can't give them puppets of their own[^2^].
 
This mod is ideal for players who want to have complete freedom and flexibility in shaping the post-war world according to their preferences and goals. It also prevents the AI from making nonsensical or unfair decisions that can ruin your game.
 
## Enhanced Peace Conference AI
 
This mod aims to remedy the chaotic peace conference AI by making the AI act in line with their historical war aims and goals and by fixing a few bugs and oversights in the vanilla peace conferences. The screenshots above come from a campaign where the Allies (and China) contributed the most by far and where the Soviets joined the war late and contributed little[^3^].
 
This mod makes several changes to the peace conference system, such as:
 
- Preventing border gore by making the AI prioritize contiguous territories and historical claims.
- Making the AI respect historical treaties and agreements, such as Yalta or Potsdam.
- Making the AI more likely to puppet or liberate countries rather than annexing them outright.
- Making the AI more aware of their ideology and faction alignment when making decisions.
- Fixing some bugs that caused the AI to ignore certain countries or regions.

This mod is ideal for players who want a more realistic and historical peace conference experience that respects the contributions and interests of each country involved. It also improves the balance and stability of the game by preventing excessive border changes or annexations.
 
## Conclusion
 
Peace conferences are a crucial part of Hearts of Iron IV, but they can also be frustrating and disappointing for many players. Fortunately, there are some mods that can enhance the peace conference system and give players more control over the outcome. Whether you prefer full control or historical accuracy, these mods can help you enjoy the game more and create your own alternate history scenarios.
